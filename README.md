# ProductWishListProject

This product is intended for anyone who shops online. 
The purpose of the software is to have a single place where a user can have all the items they plan on buying from any website.
The software can be used whenever a user finds something that they like. 
How it works is simple, just enter the information about the item you wish to buy and it adds it to a your list.
Every site has its own seperate wishlist functionality, the concept with this project is that you can have all of the items you
are planning on buying in one place; rather than having to visit each site individually.
